# 2.Top10 Cities Revenue Generated vs Top10 profit Earned Cities 

### Steps:

1.Groups the dataset by City.

2.Calculates total Sales and Profit for each city.

3.Sorts the results by Sales in descending order.

4.Returns the top 10 cities based on revenue generated

5.Performs the same grouping and aggregation.

6.Sorts the cities based on Profit in descending order.

Returns the top 10 cities that earned the highest profit.
```python
Top10RevenueCities=Data.groupby('City')
[['Sales','Profit']].sum()
.sort_values(by='Sales',ascending=False)
.head(10)

Top10ProfitCities=Data.groupby('City')

## ‚ú® Interpretation:
- 1.The first four cities ‚Äî New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Francisco ‚Äî appear in both Top Sales and Top Profit lists, indicating strong alignment between sales revenue and profitability.

- 2.This suggests these cities generate high sales efficiently, converting revenue into profit effectively.
- 3.Cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, Houston, and Jacksonville have high sales but show negative profits, possibly due to:

- i.Higher operational costs

- ii.Increased discounts or returns

- iii.Other expenses affecting profitability

- These areas require further investigation to understand why profits are negative despite good sales.

- 4.Conversely, cities such as Detroit, Lafayette, Jackson, Atlanta, and Minneapolis have moderate or low sales but are among the top profit earners.

- 5.This indicates efficient operations or higher profit margins in these locations, contributing positively to overall profitability.


# 3.1 üí∞ Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis

In this step, we calculate the CLV for each customer by combining their average purchase value, purchase frequency, and lifespan. Based on the average CLV, customers are segmented into High Value and Low Value categories.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Key Metrics:
 - 1.Average Purchase Value = Total Sales / Number of Unique Orders

 - 2.Purchase Frequency = Number of Unique Orders per Customer

- 3.Customer Lifespan = Duration between First and Last Purchase (in years)

 - 4.CLV = Average Purchase Value √ó Purchase Frequency √ó Lifespan

```python
# Calculate Average Purchase Value
1.Avg_Purchase_Value = Data.groupby('Customer ID')['Sales'].sum() / Data.groupby('Customer ID')['Order ID'].nunique()
Avg_Purchase_Value = Avg_Purchase_Value.reset_index(name='Avg_Purchase_Value')

# Calculate Customer Purchase Frequency
2.Customer_Purchase_Frequency = Data.groupby('Customer ID')['Order ID'].nunique().reset_index(name='Purchase Frequency')

# Calculate Customer Lifespan in Years
3.lifespan = Data.groupby('Customer ID').agg(
    First_Purchase=('Order Date', 'min'),
    Last_Purchase=('Order Date', 'max')
).reset_index()
4.lifespan['Lifespan_Years'] = np.floor((lifespan['Last_Purchase'] - lifespan['First_Purchase']).dt.days / 365)
5.lifespan['Lifespan_Years'] = lifespan['Lifespan_Years'].astype(int)

# Merge All DataFrames
5.CLV_Data = pd.merge(Avg_Purchase_Value, Customer_Purchase_Frequency, on='Customer ID')
6.CLV_Final_Data = pd.merge(CLV_Data, lifespan, on='Customer ID')

# Calculate CLV
7.CLV_Final_Data['Customers_Lifetime_Value'] = (
    CLV_Final_Data['Avg_Purchase_Value'] *
    CLV_Final_Data['Purchase Frequency'] *
    CLV_Final_Data['Lifespan_Years']
)

# Segment Customers Based on Average CLV
8.Avg_Clv = CLV_Final_Data['Customers_Lifetime_Value'].mean()
9.CLV_Final_Data['CLV_Segment'] = np.where(
    CLV_Final_Data['Customers_Lifetime_Value'] > Avg_Clv,
    'High Value',
    'Low Value'
)

![clv Distribution percentage]((CLV)1.png)


## ‚ú® Interpretation
 - As we Can See We have both Customers High Value and Low Value.
- High Value Customers Are More We have gained.
- There Are also Some of the Customers In High Value have More Value compared to Others giving Priorities to them is very much needed as they are helping us to create high revenue and profits.
- Customers having lifespan Between 1 to 4 years Showing Customer Loyalty Toward are business as they are Regular and Long time Customers.
- As we have total 4 Years Data We Given Lifespan Value Based on their existence in the business from First purchase  Date to Last Purchase Date to know their exact lifespan in the business.

-Customers were divided into two segments:
  - üîù **High Value**: Above average CLV
  - üîª **Low Value**: Below average CLV

### üìä Key Insights:
- üî• High Value Customers are more profitable and loyal over time.
- üí° Low Value Customers may need targeted marketing or re-engagement.
- üßæ Use this segmentation to prioritize retention strategies.

‚öñÔ∏è All Segments: Performing Well Overall
```
## ‚ú® Interpretation:
 
## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Customers vs Sales by Segment

- Based on **Customer Segments** available in the original data.
- Comparison of **total unique customers** vs **total sales generated** by each segment was done to understand overall growth across all years.
- The **Home Office** segment has **fewer customers**, while the **Consumer** segment has the **most customers**.
- In terms of sales, **Home Office generated the lowest overall sales** ‚Äî the situation is reversed between customer count and revenue.

## üìä Yearly Sales Trend by Segment

- To get a **clearer picture**, we analyzed the **yearly sales trend** of each segment.
- In **2014**, the **Home Office** segment generated the **highest sales**.
- In the latest years (**2016 and 2017**), the **Corporate** segment achieved the **top position** in sales.
- There is only a **slight difference** in total sales across all customer segments, showing **balanced and consistent performance**.

## üìà Segment Performance Overview

- **All segments are performing well** overall.
- The **Consumer** segment maintained **moderate sales** in **2015 and 2016**.

![SalesandOrders](Yearly%20Trend.png)

### ‚ú® Interpretation:
 
- ‚ùå In **2014**, the business had a good number of customers but **lost** some of them the following year.
- üîÅ Surprisingly, in **2015**, despite the drop in customers, the number of **orders increased**, indicating stronger engagement or repeat purchases.
- üìä From **2016 to 2017**, both **customers and orders showed steady growth**, highlighting a **positive customer trend**.
- ‚úÖ Comparing **customer count vs. order count** gave valuable insights ‚Äî a rise in customers clearly contributed to more orders in the later years.
- 
# 6. üîÅ Repeated vs Non-Repeated Customers
### Steps:
- 1.We first extracted all unique customers using .unique() to avoid counting duplicates. Then, we filtered the dataset to include only those unique customers for accurate analysis of their order behavior.
- 2.This code identifies whether each customer is a repeated or non-repeated buyer based on their number of unique orders. If a customer has placed more than one order, they are labeled as Repeated, else Non-Repeated.
```python
UniqueCustomers=pd.DataFrame(Data['Customer ID'].unique(),columns=['Customer ID'])

UniqueCustomersData=Data[Data['Customer ID'].isin(UniqueCustomers['Customer ID'])]

CustomersWithOrderCounts=UniqueCustomersData.groupby('Customer ID')['Order ID'].nunique()

CustomersWithOrderCounts = CustomersWithOrderCounts.reset_index()

 CustomersWithOrderCounts['Customer Type'] = np.where(

 CustomersWithOrderCounts['Order ID'] > 1, 'Repeated', 'Non-Repeated' ) 
```
![categoricals](Categorical1.png)

## ‚ú®Interpretation:
- üì¶ **Repeated Customers**: Customers who have placed **more than 1 order**.
- üßç **Non-Repeated Customers**: Customers who have placed **only 1 order**.

### üìä Why This Is Useful:
- Stored results in `CustomerswithOrderCounts` DataFrame for easy tracking and future analysis.
- üõçÔ∏è Helps identify **non-repeated customers** ‚Äî useful for targeting with:
  - üîñ Discounts
  - ü§ù Recommendations
  - üí¨ Personalized outreach

- üîÑ Repeated customer data is valuable to:
  - üîç Understand **frequently ordered products**
  - üéØ Discover customer **interests & preferences**

```
**Strong Months**: October, November, December  
*Needs Focus*: February, April
```plaintext
üî¥ Low Performing Months
- February
- April
```

###  üìä Sales Trend Summary

September and December show consistently good sales, especially in 2016 and 2017.

November 2017 recorded the highest sales overall.

February had the lowest sales across all years and needs more attention.

October sales were low in 2014 and 2015, but improved in 2016 and 2017.

The consecutive months September, October, November, and December are the strongest performing months.

### üí∞ Profit vs Sales Comparison

In 2016, highest profits were seen in October and December.

In 2017, March showed the highest profit, indicating a shift in market trend.

March had good sales in both 2016 and 2017, but profit came only in 2017.

This shows a partial correlation between high sales and profit in months like October, November, December, and March.

The business faced losses (negative profits) in early years (2014 and 2017)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Months Needing More Attention

February and March: Poor profit performance in all four years.

April: Sales similar to June and July, but not generating enough profit.

Moderate profit observed in June, July, August, and January in 2017.

Indicates a seasonal shift in profit patterns.

## üì¶ Shipping Performance & Product Category Analysis
![Shipping Performance & Product Category Analysis](Categorical.png)

## ‚ú® Interpretation:
```plaintext
üì¶ Ship Mode:  
- Standard Class used most, but delays high
üåç Regions:  
- West has most customers, South the least
üõí Products:  
- Product variety visible in sub-categories
üìà Growth:  
- Customer growth in East, Central, West
```
### üöö Shipping Mode Analysis

‚ÄòStandard Class‚Äô is the most frequently used ship mode by the business.

However, it also has the highest average delivery delay, which may impact customer satisfaction.

üìå Action Point: Investigate and improve logistics for Standard Class to reduce delays.

### üó∫Ô∏è Business Spread Across Regions & Categories

üèôÔ∏è Region-wise State Count

Central and East regions have the highest number of states covered.

Indicates that the business has tried to expand widely across these areas.

### üë• Customer Count by Region

Despite fewer states, the West region has the highest customer count over 4 years.

South region has the lowest customer engagement.

East and Central regions also show good customer numbers, with East slightly leading.

‚úÖ Positive Trend: There's consistent growth in customers in East, Central, and West regions.


### üì¶ Product Category Spread

Count of Sub-Categories within each Product Category shows the diversity in offerings.

Helps understand how broad the product catalog is under each category.

üîç Key Takeaways

‚ö†Ô∏è Standard Class delays should be addressed to maintain service quality.

üß≠ South region needs focused marketing or service improvements to boost customer base.

üìä East region is performing well in terms of both state presence and customer base ‚Äî shows potential for further growth.

üõí Expanding product diversity under well-performing categories can support business growth.

## Explaination:

**üìå R (Recency): Calculate days since each customer's last purchase.**

**üîÅ F (Frequency): Count how many orders each customer placed.**

**üí∞ M (Monetary): Sum total spending by each customer.**

**üìä Scoring: Use qcut() to assign scores (1‚Äì4) for R, F, and M.**

**üè∑Ô∏è Segmenting: Classify customers based on RFM scores into groups like Champions, Loyal, At Risk, etc.**
Others**

 ## ‚ú® Interpretation:
 
### üèÜ Champion Customers
- High R, F, and M scores
- Recent buyers, frequent, and high spenders

### ü§ù Loyal Customers
- Good frequency and recency
- Moderate monetary score

### üå± Potential Loyalist
- Recently active but low frequency

### ‚ö†Ô∏è At-Risk Customers
- Haven‚Äôt bought recently but used to buy often

### üíî Lost Customers
- Low in all 3 areas

### üìå Others
- Do not fit into clear categories

# ‚úÖ Recommendations
- Monitor sales vs profit ratio regularly‚Äîdon‚Äôt just push for higher sales.
- Conduct marketing surveys in the South region to understand low performance and address issues.
- Optimize or reconsider the Standard Class shipping method to reduce average delivery delays.
- Offer incentives for customers to choose faster and more reliable shipping modes.
- Offer targeted discounts to "At Risk" or "Lost" RFM segments.
- Re-engage non-repeating customers with personalized offers or recommendations.

# ‚úÖ Limitations
**‚ùå No Customer Feedback or Ratings**
The dataset does not include customer reviews or satisfaction scores, so we cannot determine the exact reasons why some customers stopped purchasing.

**üìâ No Marketing or Promotion Data**
There is no information on advertisements, campaigns, or promotions, which limits the ability to assess their impact on sales and customer behavior.

**‚è≥ Unclear Reasons for Delivery Delays**
Although shipping delays are measured, there is no data on external factors (like weather, holidays, or supplier issues), making it difficult to identify exact causes.

üìå Conclusion
The business showed strong growth in recent years, especially in festive months.

West region had the highest customer base; South region needs more focus.

'Standard Class' shipping caused the most delivery delays.

RFM and CLV analysis helped identify loyal and at-risk customers.

These insights can guide better marketing, logistics, and customer strategies.
